# Rapid-Review-api

This is a api project which is build using node Js and express JS framework. Using this api, It is possible to build front-end review app that can perform all the crud functionalites with proper token and cookie authentication. All the routes of this api is protected and users need to go through token authentication in order to use the protected routes. MongoDB and Mongoose were used to perform database functionalities. As aim of this api is to provide support to the front end developers, therefore making this api live was not essential. Those who wants to use this api need to use their own mongodb account. There are detailed instructions in this readme file on how to properly use and customize this api. Postman documentation with all the api endpoints is also linked in this documentation.
